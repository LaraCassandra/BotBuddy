<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][Images/image-1.png]

### Project Description

Technology is becoming more prominent in our everyday lives, the notion of robots and robotics integrating into society is quickly becoming normalised and accepted by most. As a developer, I form a part of the movement of technology and so it is important that learn how it can be better integrated to suit the users and the masses.

My Bot Buddy is a virtual pet application that allows you to look after your cute little robot friend by performing several interactions that keep it alive and happy. Whilst being a fun and lighthearted theme, I specifically targeted My Bot Buddy to help users become more informed of robots and view them in a positive light.
