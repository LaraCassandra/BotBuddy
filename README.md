<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][Images/image-1.png]

### Project Description

Technology is becoming more prominent in our everyday lives, the notion of robots and robotics integrating into society is quickly becoming normalised and accepted by most. As a developer, I form a part of the movement of technology and so it is important that learn how it can be better integrated to suit the users and the masses.

My Bot Buddy is a virtual pet application that allows you to look after your cute little robot friend by performing several interactions that keep it alive and happy. Whilst being a fun and lighthearted theme, I specifically targeted My Bot Buddy to help users become more informed of robots and view them in a positive light.

### Built With

* [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/)
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
## Concept Process

### Ideation

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* Made use of `OOP` to create `classes and objects` to hold 
the information of the bot buddy and 
create the necessary functions, 
interactions and timekeepers.
* Used C#'s built-in `random function`  to get 
random numbers which I used to make the 
equations for the user to answer for the 
repair interaction. I also used random to 
implement the bot's response for the 
tic-tac-toe game.
* `Timekeeper` used to decay the 
needs of the bot, the timer would 
reset if there was an interaction, 
otherwise if left long enough the bot 
would eventually malfunction and a n
ew bot would have to be made.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* First time I've ever built a cross-platform `mobile application` which was very exciting
* A unique and relevant `theme` for my virtual pet that made for my interactions to be quite different.
* Challenging my to make a simple game of `tic-tac-toe` within my application and getting it *mostly* working :)

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Understanding the concept of `object-oriented programming` was and *is still* quite difficult to wrap my head around
* Implementing `timekeepers` to decay the needs at different intervals without breaking the other timekeepers
* Visual Studio `design preview` not working so I had to keep the emulator running to design my frontend

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Feedback from Reviews

Not applicable

#### Unit Tests

Not applicable

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Improve and fix the `timekeeping` so that it does not break the application
* Ability to `change name` or `type of robot`
* Add a `progress bar` to show the health of the virtual pet
* Implement more `interactions` when leveling up
* Improve the overall aesthetics and interface
